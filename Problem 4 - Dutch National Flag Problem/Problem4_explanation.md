# Problems vs Algorithms - Problem 4 - Dutch National Flag Problem - Explanation

## Logic implemented
The solution uses an in-place heapsort to sort a list containing the integers 0, 1, and 2 in a single traversal.

## Run time complexity: ```O(n)```
Because of while loop time complexity is of ```O(n)```

## Space complexity: ```O(1)```
It sorts in place so no additional space was required.

As a result, the space complexity if of O(1).
