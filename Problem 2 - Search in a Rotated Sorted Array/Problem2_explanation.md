# Problems vs Algorithms - Problem 2 - Search in a Rotated Sorted Array - Explanation

## Logic implemented
Binary Search technique was used to locate the value within the rotated sorted array.

## Run time complexity: ```O(log(n))```
The run time complexity is the same as a Binary Search, which is of ```O(log(n))```

## Space complexity: ```O(1)```
Binary Search takes constant space. As a result, the space complexity is of ```O(1)```
