# Problems vs Algorithms - Problem 6 - Unsorted Integer Array - Explanation

## Logic implemented
We have two variavles min and max. We don't need to sort anything.
Linear Search algorithm is used in an unsorted array.

* We traversed the array from first to last index
* We compare and update the min and max values in each iteration
* At last we get the required values and return the min/max values as the result.

## Run time complexity: ```O(n)```
Used a single traversal and implemented Linear Search, which is of ```O(n)``` time complexity.

## Space complexity: ```O(1)```
Linear search is implemented. Constant space is used.

As a result, the space complexity if of ```O(1)```.
