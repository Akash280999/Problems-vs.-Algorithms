# Problems vs Algorithms - Problem 1 - Finding the Square Root of an Integer - Explanation

## Logic implemented
Instead of a linear search, Binary Search algorithm is used to locate the square root value.

## Run time complexity: ```O(log n)```
The time complexity of binary search is ```O(log n)```.

## Space complexity: ```O(1)```
Constant extra space is needed.
